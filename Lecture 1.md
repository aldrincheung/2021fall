# mesopotamia
# irrigation process/systems - water
-> attract people -> community grew (presists) -> SPECIALISTS    [IMMIGRATION]
become the beginnings/early stages of cities
each river is a god -> apease the god cuz people DEPEND on it
    -> religion


# advantages of river
-linen from the plants beside the river
    -> specialist on collecting plants for linen
-clay in the river
    -> pottery (store grains)
-clay tablets (books) -> fire 
    -> becase clay tablets would disinerate/detirirate -> librarian copy/restore tablets

# switching from hunting and gathering (more stable, bigger cities)


# early place of worship
    -> cigaret (temples) 
    -> priests live near by 

# managing and protecting territory
    -> militaries
    -> walls

# because of its unifying nature
    -> develop trade


# Selective Breeding
    -> sheep used to be hairy, instead of wooly
    -> wool is easier to deal with than lenin
    -> became efficient and have large amount -> trading

# Through trading -> in south of Afghanistan
    -> lapis lazuli, shiny 
    -> shiny round shapes to decorate cigaret
    -> then found glass from sand beside river (cheaper, faster, just as good)

# Glass -> specialized and efficient
    -> started with the sole purpose

# Cities became industrialized -> new type of society
    # Attract more people (business)

    # Alike people attract to each other,
        -> have neighborhoods to gather/develop smiliar people
        -> specialized

# hygiene -> disease
        - subjected to flooding and moving of the river
    - loses 7.5 per thousand people
    - city kept shrink until they collapse  ->  bring more people in
        - military -> war -> slaves  (imported, not sustainable | doesn't form family

    - family renew people (along with infant mortality)

    - improve with garbage disposal -> city become more sustainable

    - population constant flux -> management tends to be martoliant (need to be strong)

# cities transition from import of goods to exports of goods

# Things they have
    waggons -> certain/standardized width

# one specific ideology that bind up the city
    IDEOLOGY They don't know each other, the binding thing needs to be attract (devotes of a certain GOD -> power in priesthood) [the real power]
    - the city scope (prob religion)
    - the neighborhood scope (prob their craft)

# NEW KIND of economy
    varied economy
        - all kinds of craft (agriculture, glass, iron) -> new industry all the time
    economic structure is not unifying, even at odds
        - compete each other

# Characteristics of city
    - large complex economic engine
    - ideology that holds it together

# Modern City is not that different
    - nationalized, not one religion per area
    

# Explanation
    - france is not a 
        government is CENTRALIZED
        send bureaucrats are sent out to the country side
        local play no part (everything is controlled by the central government)

# "fun" facts
    -> burial outside of cities and man-made caves (a lot in Rome)
    -> "When the builder constructs the capital, the city should be a fang (a foursided orthogonal shape) nine li aon ech side with three gates each. within the city are nine"
    -> chinese cities are rebuilt on a regular basis -> build on wood  [Didn't use stones, don't have as much access]

One key point here I think is that there are two central factors holding cities together: economic engine and ideology (belief system). The economic system is broken up into different parts that are sometimes antagonistic to each other. So ideology helps to balance out by providing a more unified point of group cohesion.
